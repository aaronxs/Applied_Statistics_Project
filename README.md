# Applied Statistics Final Project Codes
* This repository all of the codes I wrote for the final project of the course Methods of Applied Statistics I (STA2101) at the University of Toronto
* In this project I used models such as logistic & Poisson regression as well as categorical analysis techniques such as chi-square test, likelihood ratio test and Fisher's exact test to determine the probability of an NBA team making the playoff as well as the impact of certain variable in predicting it
* The codes in folder DataScrape contains the Python codes I used to acquire as well as "clean" and manipulate data from http://www.basketball-reference.com.
* The codes in folder DataTransform contains the VBA codes I wrote to transform the codes into the desired format for the subsequent statistical analysis 
* The codes in folder StatsAnalysis contains the R codes I used to perform statistical analysis on the data
